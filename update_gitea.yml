    Updating to a new version
You can update to a new version of Gitea by stopping Gitea, replacing the binary at /usr/local/bin/gitea and restarting the instance. The binary file name should not be changed during the update to avoid problems in existing repositories.

It is recommended you do a backup before updating your installation.

If you have carried out the installation steps as described above, the binary should have the generic name gitea. Do not change this, i.e. to include the version number.
